  * INFO/Requirements:
    * IS IT FREE, PAID, SUBSCRIPTION?
    * DOES IT REQUIRE SPECIFIC HARDWARE OR ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO RUN? IF NOT THEN DO NOT CREATE THIS SECOND BULLET

  * Description:
    BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICE, THIS CAN USUALLY JUST BE PULLED FROM THE PROJECTS HOME PAGE
    
  * Additional categories:
    USE THIS SECTION TO TELL US IF THE SERVICE COULD ALSO COVER OTHER USE CASES AS WELL. AS AN EXAMPLE PLEX IS PRIMARILY KNOWN FOR MANAGING MOVIES, MUSIC, AND TV SHOWS SO IT REALLY BELONGS IN THAT CATEGORY. 
    HOWEVER PLEX ALSO NOW HAS PERSONAL PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH AUTOMATIC MOBILE UPLOADS THROUGH ITS APP, THAT NEW FEATURE CAN BE LISTED HERE, INSTEAD OF ADDING PLEX TO MULTIPLE CATEGORIES.   
    IF THERE IS NOTHING TO PUT HERE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ADD THIS "ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES" SECTION.
