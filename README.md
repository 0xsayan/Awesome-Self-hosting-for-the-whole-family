# Awesome-Self-hosting-for-the-whole-family
Selfhosting is the process of locally hosting and managing applications instead of renting from SaaS providers. And 9 times out of 10 it results in a frustrated spouce or family members who endup using "the cloud" anyway because they cant figure out how to use the server you setup. 

This is a list for thoes of us who primarily live on our mobile devices, or have family members who do, but still want the privacy, security, and control of our own data that self-hosting provides. 

The goal of this list is to curate all self-hosted services avaliable that have mobile counterparts. 

* All services must have a Android **and** iOS app to make the list, or at the very least have apps in development. 
* 3rd party apps are ok, so long as they provide all core functionality of the service they are designed to work with. 
* The mobile apps must not require Root or Jailbreak, and must be avaliable through an official Appstore.
* Opensource is always preferable, however Proprietary, paid, or even services that require specific/proprietary hardware are all welcome here, and will be specified next to each app.
